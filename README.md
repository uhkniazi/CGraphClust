# Constructor - CGraph 
Arguments - bipartite graph object of igraph library, with vertices of the first kind assigned id TRUE and of second type
assigned a FALSE. 
# Internal Functions
# CGraph.assign.marginal.probabilities
vertices of the first kind are assigned probabilities
# CGraph.project
assigns a level of interestingness/leverage or observed to expected ratio to each edge after graph projection on the vertex of first kind i.e. type = TRUE.

# data acccessor functions

# CGraphClust Class
class to create a igraph and hclust object based on 2 criteria: 1) shared properties or connections with type 2 vertices in a bipartite graph and 2) positive correlation value.

# Constructor - CGraphClust
Arguments - a data frame of 2 columns and n rows, where column 1 represents vertices of type 1 (e.g. Gene symbols) and column 2
represents vertices of type 2 (e.g. Pathways related to the corresponding gene symbol). A correlation matrix of the expression
values of e.g. the Genes with column and rownames being the same as the entries in column 1 of the data frame. The third argument
is a cutoff value of correlations (default is 0.5) - i.e. anything below 0.5 is not considered to be related. 
# step 1
bipartite graph is created and some cleaning performed, i.e. those type 2 vertices with too many connections (degree) with type 1
vertices are removed. this is done by looking at the distribution of the degrees on a log scale and approximating a negative
binomial and poisson distributions on top. the cutoff is by default 0.95 quantile under a negative binomial model, anything over that
is removed. The idea is that type vertices that have a lot of connections, are not very interesting and they tend to hide the
more interesting connections.
# step 2
graph is projected on to one dimension (type 1 vertices) and connections between type 1 vertices are assigned interestingness or 
observed to expected probability ratios as weights. the weights on a square root scale follow a negative binomial distribution
and only the highest weights are chosen, as they are the most interesting. So anything over 0.95 quantile under a neg bin model
are chosen and the other connections are discarded.
# step 3
a correlation matrix is converted to an adjacency matrix with a 0 diagonal and converted to a graph. Only those edges greater than
or equal to the cutoff value (default 0.5) are chosen.
# step 4
the 2 graphs are intersected and only those connections are remaining that are positively correlated and have a very high observed 
to expected ratios. edge betweeness community finding algorithm is used to detect clusters in this graph. NOTE: if the number of 
edges is over 3000 then the program stops as this may not give a solution without running out of memory or a reasonable amount of 
time. A different algorithm is recommended.
# step 5
the community is converted to a hclust object which can be used for plotting and heatmaps. each cluster is also assigned a 
label based on which is the most common type 2 vertex (e.g. pathway) in that cluster and can be accessed via the
getClusterLabels function.
